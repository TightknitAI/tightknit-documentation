# Community Guidelines

Your Community Guidelines can be updated by clicking `Community Guidelines` in the **Moderation** module in App Home. Community Guidelines saved in Tightknit are displayed on the `/community-guidelines` [page of the Companion Site](/companion-site/pages/community-guidelines).

The Community Guidelines can also be used in AI moderation (_coming soon_!).
