# Tutorial: Zapier Webhook â†’ Zoom

In this tutorial, we will use Zapier to connect Tightknit's one-click event registration to a Zoom webinar. When a user clicks the register button in Slack, they will be marked as an attendee in the Tightknit system _and_ automatically get registered for the Zoom webinar.

<Steps>
### Create a new Zap

To get started, open then [Zapier zap editor](https://zapier.com/app/zaps) and create a new zap ([instructions](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496309697421-Create-Zaps)). Alternatively, you can clone our pre-made [zap template](https://zapier.com/shared/tightknit-events-webhook-zoom-webinar/b57cd610b355ef5d83e8299cd9b1f487b5d25481).

### Add the "Webhooks" trigger

Add the initial trigger for your zap and search for the "Webhooks by Zapier" action.

<Callout type="info">
  The [Webhooks by Zapier](https://zapier.com/features/webhooks) action requires
  a Premium Zapier account.
</Callout>

### Configure the Webhook

Click on the action to open the webhook settings.

1. Under the "App & Event" tab, keep the _Event_ as _Catch Hook_. Click Continue.
1. Under the "Trigger" tab, keep the settings. Click Continue.
1. Under the "Test" tab, find your webhook URL and copy it.

![Zapier Webhook Test tab](/events/tutorials/zapier-webhook-test-tab.png)

Zapier is now listening for applications sending data to this URL. We'll leave the Zap here for the moment and come back to it in a later step.

### Register the Webhook URL with Tightknit

Open the Tightknit admin Event Settings in Slack, by opening the Tightknit app home and clicking the `Events` button under the _Events Platform_ module.

Paste the webhook URL from the previous step into the _Webhook URL_ field, and click Save.

![Event Admin Settings](/events/events-admin-settings.png)

Tightknit is now configured to send registration data to the Zapier webhook URL.

### Get Zoom Meeting ID

Log in to the Zoom online portal and navigate to your Meetings/Webinars. To work with Zoom's registration APIs, we simply need the ID of the meeting/webinar, which you can find in the details of the event. Copy the ID without the spaces.

![Zoom ID](/events/tutorials/zoom-id.png)

### Register the Zoom ID with your Tightknit Event

We need to include the Zoom ID in the data sent to the Zap so that Zapier knows which specific Zoom event the user registered for.

Open the Tightknit events list in Slack by clicking the `Events` button in the app home or by typing the `\events` command. Click the `â€¢â€¢â€¢` menu next to your event and select `Edit`.

![Edit Tightknit Event](/events/tutorials/edit-event-menu.png)

Under the **Registration Settings** section, paste the Zoom meeting ID into the _Webhook Custom Metadata_ field. Click Save.

![Event Custom Metadata Settings](/events/tutorials/event-custom-metadata.png)

Tightknit will now include the Zoom ID in the data sent to the webhook URL.

### Test the Tightknit Webhook

It's easier to work with sample data, so let's do a test run. Register for your own Tightknit event in Slack. You can do this by clicking the `â€¢â€¢â€¢` menu next to your event and selecting the registration option.

![Event Registration Menu Option](/events/tutorials/registration-menu-option.png)

<Callout type="info">
  The exact label of the registration option may differ depending on your
  community's configuration.
</Callout>

### Verify Data Received by Zap

Jump back to the Zap editor from earlier. Under the "Test" tab, click the `Find new records` button. You should see at least one record of your registration test run in the previous step. Select the record and click `Continue with selected record`.

![Event Registration Menu Option](/events/tutorials/zapier-test-data.png)

This sample data will give us useful visual aids in Zapier when selecting fields from the webhook data.

### Add Zoom Action to Zap

In the Zap editor, click the `+` to add a new action. Search for the "Zoom" action.

![Zapier to Zoom zap](/events/tutorials/zapier-to-zoom.png)

### Configure Zoom Action

Click on the Zoom action to open the settings. We will instruct Zoom on how to register a new user based on the incoming data Tightknit sends to Zapier.

1. Under the "App & Event" tab, select _Create Webinar Registrant_ or _Create Meeting Registrant_, depending on your Zoom event type. Click Continue.
1. Under the "Account" tab, login to to your Zoom account. Click Continue.
1. Under the "Action" tab, configure the following fields:

- **Upcoming Webinar** - this will be the ID of the Zoom meeting/webinar, which we've configured Tightknit to send in the _Custom Metadata_ field of the webhook data. Select the _Custom_ tab, search for "Custom Metadata", and select the "Custom Metadata" option associated with the webhook trigger.
- **Email** - select the "User Email" field from the webhook trigger.
- **First Name** - select the "User First Name" field from the webhook trigger.

![Zapier Zoom Action](/events/tutorials/zapier-zoom-action.png)

<Callout type="info">
  You're free to fill in any additional fields as you like. Keep in mind
  Tightknit will send along any [custom profile
  fields](https://slack.com/help/articles/212281478-Customize-member-profiles)
  configured for Slack profiles in the workspace
  ([example](../event-registration#events-webhook)). Consider adding some
  profile fields if they would serve as helpful user registration info.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Do NOT hardcode the Zoom action input values. It's an easy mistake to set the
  **Upcoming Webinar** to a specific Zoom meeting in the dropdown list. If you
  accidentally do this, users that registers for _any_ event in Slack will
  always be forwarded to that one particular Zoom meeting, even if they were
  trying to register for a different event.
</Callout>

### Test Zoom Action

Let's make sure Zapier can find the correct Zoom meeting/webinar with a test run.

Under the "Test" tab, you can click the `Test step` button. If you own the Zoom event, you will be met with an error. Don't worry - that's expected! Zoom does not allow the owner to register for their own event. This is proof you've successfully connected to your Zoom event!

Click `Continue` or `Skip`.

### Publish and Enable the Zap

Click the `Publish` button in the top toolbar to save your changes.

![Zapier Publish Button](/events/tutorials/zapier-publish-button.png)

Next, click the On/Off toggle in the top-left of the toolbar to enable your Zap. It should show a green `On`.

![Zapier On/Off Button](/events/tutorials/zapier-on-off-button.png)

Your Zap is now live and ready to forward your Tightknit event registrations to Zoom! ðŸŽ‰

### BONUS: Add Branching Logic for Register vs. Unregister

Right now, our zap assumes every time data is sent to the webhook it means a new user has registered for an event. Technically this is not true! Tightknit sends other kind of data too, such as a user _unregistering_ for an event.

Let's assume you want to take some sort of action, or simply ignore, an _unregister_ event. We'll need to add branching logic in the zap in order to differentiate based on the incoming data. In this case, we'll create a branch based on the `status` field of the [Tightknit webhook data](../event-registration#events-webhook).

Add a zap action in between the Webhook and the Zoom actions. Select the **Paths by Zapier** action, and configure each branch as follows:

- Name the left-side branch "Registered". Choose a custom rule that will continue if `Status` exactly matches "registered".
- Name the right-side branch "Unregistered". Choose a custom rule that will continue if `Status` exactly matches "unregistered".

<Callout>
  **Zapier Limitation** <br />
  Zaps that contain the **Paths** action cannot be copied or converted into a template.
</Callout>

Move the Zoom action under the left-side branch. When you're finished, your zap should look something like this:

![Zapier Paths](/events/tutorials/zapier-paths.png)

You must add some action under the right-hand side too before you can publish the Zap. If you'd rather just completely ignore _unregister_ events, you can use the **Filter** Zapier action instead of **Paths**, and only continue if `Status` exactly matches "registered".
