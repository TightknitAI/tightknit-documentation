In the Event Settings panel, you will be able to configure:

- **Events List Page** - if disabled, the Events List route will not be present or accessible in the companion site, including in the navigation sidebar
- **Registration Button Text** - the text shown within registration buttons for registration-enabled events
- **Event Unregistration** - when enabled, users will receive an option to remove themselves (unregister) from an event once they have registered. When disabled, users will not see this option.
- **Event Reminders** - when enabled, event participants and registrants receive a reminder DM prior to the event starting
