# Tutorial: Make Webhook â†’ Zoom

In this tutorial, we will use [Make](https://www.make.com) with Tightknit's one-click event registration so that you can forward registrations into Zoom. In other words, when a user clicks the register button in Slack, they will be marked as an attendee in the Tightknit system _and_ automatically get registered for your Zoom webinar.

<Steps>
### Create a new Scenario

To get started, open the scenario editor in Make and create a new scenario ([instructions](https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/scenario-editors)).

### Add the Webhook trigger

Add the initial trigger module and search for "Webhooks". Select "Custom webhook".

![Make webhook](/events/tutorials/make-webhook.png)

Click the `Create a webhook` button. Give the webhook a name such as "Webhook for Tightknit Events" and click Save.

### Copy the Webhook URL

Locate the URL for your webhook and copy it. You can also click the `Copy address to clipboard` button.

![Make webhook URL](/events/tutorials/make-webhook-url.png)

### Register the Webhook URL with Tightknit

In the Tighktnit [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) admin settings, [register a new webhook](/integrations/webhooks#register-a-new-webhook) using the webhook URL from the previous step.

### Get Zoom Meeting ID

Log in to the Zoom online portal and navigate to your Meetings/Webinars. To work with Zoom's registration APIs, we simply need the ID of the meeting/webinar, which you can find in the details of the event. Copy the ID without the spaces.

### Register the Zoom ID with your Tightknit Event Webhook

We need to include the Zoom ID in the data sent to the Make scenario so that Make knows which specific Zoom event the user registered for.

Open the Tightknit events list in Slack by clicking the `Events` button in the app home or by typing the `\events` command. Click the `â€¢â€¢â€¢` menu next to your event and select `Edit`.

![Edit Tightknit Event](/events/tutorials/edit-event-menu.png)

Under the **Registration Settings** section, configure the following:

1. Select your webhook for **Webhook for Registration Data**
2. Paste the Zoom meeting ID into the **Webhook Custom Metadata** field

Click Save.

Tightknit is now configured to send registration data to your webhook endpoint, including the Zoom ID.

### Test the Tightknit Webhook

It's easier to work with sample data, so let's do a test run. In the scenario editor, click the `Run once` button.

![Make Run once button](/events/tutorials/make-run-once-button.png)

![Make listening webhook](/events/tutorials/make-webhook-listening.png)

Make will be listening for incoming webhook data.

Now, back in Slack, register for your own Tightknit event. You can do this by clicking the `â€¢â€¢â€¢` menu next to your event and selecting the registration option.

  The exact label of the registration option may differ depending on your
  community's configuration.

### Verify Data Received by Make

In the scenario editor, you should see that the scenario run was completed. Click the `1` bubble above the webhook module. This will show you the data that the webhook received from Tightknit.

![Make Webhook data](/events/tutorials/make/make-zoom-example-data.png)

This sample data will give us useful visual aids in Make when selecting fields from the webhook data.

  The shape of Tightknit's webhook data may change. Please check the [API
  docs](/events/event-registration#events-webhook) for the latest.

### Add Zoom Module to Scenario

In the scenario editor, click the `+` action by hovering over the side of the webhook module. Search for "Zoom" and select the "Add a Meeting Registrant" or "Add a Webinar Registrant" action, depending on your event type.

![Make new Zoom module](/events/tutorials/make/make-zoom-module.png)

### Configure Zoom Module

Under **Connection**, log into your Zoom account to authenticate the Make connection.

Configure the Zoom module as follows:

- **User ID** - Select your user id from the list
- **Meeting/Webinar ID** - this will be the ID of the Zoom meeting/webinar, which we've configured Tightknit to send in the _Custom Metadata_ field of the webhook data. Select the `custom_metadata` option associated with the webhook trigger sample data.
- **Email** - select `user: email`.
- **First Name** - select `user: first_name`.

![Zoom module config](/events/tutorials/make/make-zoom-config.png)

<Callout type="warning">
  Do NOT hardcode the Zoom action input values. It's an easy mistake to set the
  **Meeting/Webinar ID** to a specific Zoom id. If you accidentally do this,
  users that registers for _any_ event in Slack will always be forwarded to that
  one particular Zoom meeting, even if they were trying to register for a
  different event.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Keep in mind Tightknit will also send along any [custom profile
  fields](https://slack.com/help/articles/212281478-Customize-member-profiles)
  configured for Slack profiles in the workspace
  ([example](../event-registration#events-webhook)). Consider adding some
  profile fields if they would serve as helpful user registration info.
</Callout>

### Save and Enable

Click the ðŸ’¾ save button and switch on the toggle to enable your scenario.

![Make Save button](/events/tutorials/make-save.png)

Your Make scenario is now live and ready to forward your Tightknit event registrations to Zoom! ðŸŽ‰

### BONUS: Add Branching Logic for Register vs. Unregister

Right now, our scenario assumes that every time data is sent to the webhook it means a new user has registered for an event. Technically this is not true! Tightknit sends other kind of data too, such as a user _unregistering_ for an event.

Let's assume you want to take some sort of action, or simply ignore, an _unregister_ event. We'll need to add branching logic in the scenario in order to differentiate based on the incoming data. In this case, we'll create a branch based on the `status` field of the [Tightknit webhook data](../event-registration#events-webhook).

Click on the wrench icon in between the Webhook and the Zoom actions. Select the **Add a router** option. In order to add a new branch to the flow, click the Router module itself. On each of the branches, click on the wrench icon and select **Set up a filter**.

- Name the first branch "Registered". Create a condition that will continue if `status` is equal to "registered".
- Name the second branch "Unregistered". Create a condition that will continue if `status` is equal to "unregistered".

When you're finished, the scenario should look something like this:

![Make Router](/events/tutorials/make/make-zoom-branching.png)

If you'd rather just completely ignore _unregister_ events, instead of using the Router you can simply add a filter on the path to the Zoom module with the condition the flow will continue if `status` is equal to "registered".
