# Manage Events

To see your community's upcoming events within a Slack workspace, there is a global shortcut to show events to all users within a workspace.
The easiest way to access this shortcut is to type `/events` in any message input box.
This will display a list of all events that are currently scheduled.

From this panel, everyone in the community can:

- See all upcoming events
- See all past events

For Admins and designated champion users they can:

- Create new event drafts
- Publish events or Request approval for events (Learn more about the approval process [here](/events/approve-event.md))
- Edit and delete events

## Modifying Events

Tightknit makes event management a breeze. If you need to edit the details of an event that has already been published and announced, Tightknit will automatically update _all_ of the announcement messages in Slack. ðŸ™Œ

Accidentally published the event to the wrong channel? No problem! You can modify the publish settings of an existing event too, even if it is published! If you add a new channel for a published event, we will immediately post a new announcement message in that channel. If you remove a channel for a published event, we will delete the announcement message from that channel.
