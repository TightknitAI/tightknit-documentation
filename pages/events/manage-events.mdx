# Manage Events

To see your community's upcoming events within a Slack workspace, there is a global shortcut to show events to all users within a workspace.
The easiest way to access this shortcut is to type `/events` in any message input box.
This will display a list of all events that are currently scheduled.

From this panel, everyone in the community can:

- See all upcoming events
- See all past events

For Admins and designated champion users they can:

- Create new event drafts
- Publish events or Request approval for events (Learn more about the approval process [here](/events/approve-event.md))
- Edit and delete events

## Modifying Events

Tightknit makes event management a breeze. If you need to edit the details of an event that has already been published and announced, Tightknit will automatically update _all_ of the announcement messages in Slack. ðŸ™Œ
