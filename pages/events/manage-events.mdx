Tightknit makes event management a breeze. If you need to edit the details of an event that has already been published and announced, Tightknit will automatically update _all_ of the announcement messages in Slack. ðŸ™Œ

Accidentally published the event to the wrong channel? No problem! You can modify the publish settings of an existing event too, even if it is published! If you add a new channel for a published event, we will immediately post a new announcement message in that channel. If you remove a channel for a published event, we will delete the announcement message from that channel.
