Slack is an incredibly powerful tool for building community and engaging your community with new events.
With Tightknit, you can:

- 📝 Create, edit, and delete events directly from Slack
- 🎁 Share events with your community across multiple channels
- 🏆 Allow champions to create events with an integrated approval flow

### Coming Soon

- 📅 Automatically remind members of upcoming events
- 🎫 Enable members to RSVP to events directly from Slack

### Allowing non-Admins to Create Events

By default, only Admins can create events.
If you would like to allow non-Admins to create events, you can do so by adding users to the "Champion" role.

To add a user to the "Champion" role, go the Tightknit app in Slack and click the `Champions` button.

You'll now see this panel where you can add up to 30 users to the "Champion" role.
