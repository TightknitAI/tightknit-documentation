# Add an Event Recap

## Recap Structure

When you add a recap to an event, it is added as a reply on the original event announcement Slack message. This is helpful for users following the announcement thread. You may optionally choose to broadcast the recap message to the entire channel so that all its users will see the recap update.

The image below is an example of a broadcasted recap added to the `Pinnacle Solution's 10th Anniversary!` event:

Tightknit will also remove any registration-related buttons and add a `View Recording` button (if a recording link is provided).

## Adding a Recap

![Recap Menu Option](/events/recap/recap-menu-option.png)

Once your event has passed, you will be able to add an event recap. In the Events List panel, find your event under **Past** events, and select the `‚è™ Add Recap` option from the dropdown menu.

![Recap Modal](/events/recap/recap-modal.png)

In the Event Recap panel, you will be able to configure:

- **Recap Message** - the body of the recap message
- **Event Recording Link** - a link to a video recording of the event
- **Broadcast Recap Message to Channel** - whether the broadcast message is additionally broadcasted as a new message to the entire channel (_see [Recap Structure](#recap-structure)_)

Recaps are added to all of the channels the event was originally published to. You may return to this panel to update your recap as needed. If all inputs are left blank, the recap message(s) will be deleted.
