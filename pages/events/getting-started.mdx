# Getting Started

Slack is an incredibly powerful tool for building community and engaging your community with new events.
With Tightknit, you can:

- 📝 Create, edit, and delete events directly from Slack
- 🎁 Share events with your community across multiple channels
- 🎫 Enable members to RSVP to events directly from Slack
- 🏆 Allow champions to create events with an integrated approval flow
- ⚡ Automatically update Slack event announcements across all channels
- 📅 Remind members of upcoming events
- ⏪ Recaps and recordings

### Accessing Events

Use the global shortcut `/events` to open to the Events modal. The shortcut option will appear as you type `/events` into any conversation message.

Alternatively, users can access the modal by clicking the `Events` button in the Tightknit app home under the **Events** module section.

### Allowing non-Admins to Create Events

By default, only Admins can create events.
If you would like to allow non-Admins to create events, you can do so by adding users to a Group which is assigned a Permission Set with the Event Champion permissions enabled.
