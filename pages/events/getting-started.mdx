# Getting Started

Slack is an incredibly powerful tool for building community and engaging your community with new events.
With Tightknit, you can:

- 📝 Create, edit, and delete events directly from Slack
- 🎁 Share events with your community across multiple channels
- 🎫 Enable members to RSVP to events directly from Slack
- 🏆 Allow champions to create events with an integrated approval flow
- ⚡ Automatically update Slack event announcements across all channels
- 📅 Remind members of upcoming events
- ⏪ Recaps and recordings

## Accessing Events

Use the global shortcut `/events` to open to the Events modal. The shortcut option will appear as you type `/events` into the search bar or any conversation message.

Alternatively, users can access the modal by clicking the `Events` button in the Tightknit app home under the **Events** module.

<Callout type="info">
  For non-admin users, the Events List modal displays all events published to
  any channel in the workspace.
</Callout>

## Events List Panel

To see your community's upcoming events within a Slack workspace, any user in the workspace may use the [global shortcut](/events/getting-started#accessing-events) to show events to all users within a workspace.
The easiest way to access this shortcut is to type `/events` in any message input box.
This will display a list of all public events that are currently scheduled.
