# Create a New Event

Creating an event is a great way to engage your community and share important information.
Events can be published on the companion site and in select Slack channels.

<Steps>

### Go to the Events Modal

![Manage Events Panel](/events/manage-events-panel.png)

Use the global shortcut `/events` to navigate to the Events modal. Alternatively, users can access the modal by clicking the `Events` button in the Tightknit app home.

From here, press the `+ Create New Event` button.

  If you do not see the `+ Create New Event` button, you may not have the proper
  permissions to create events. Please contact your admin for more information.

### Add Event Information

Here is where you will add the event title, description, date, time, and location.

- **Title**: The title of the event.
- **Hosts**: The host(s) of the event.
- **Start Date**: The start date and time of the event.
- **End Date**: The end date and time of the event.
- **Link**: A relevant link for the event. Must be a proper `https://` URL. If the Link is not provided, you must provide the Location instead.
- **Location**: The location or address of the event. If the Location is not provided, you must provide the Link instead.
- **Description**: A brief description of the event.

### Upload Event Image

You can upload an image for the event. This will be displayed on the event card and detail page.
The image proportions are a square. We recommend a 300x300px image.

### Designate Channels and Public Visibility

In this panel, you'll also select which Slack channels you want the event to be published to. You may select up to 10 channels.

Here is also where you can choose to make the event publicly shared on the companion site. The event will appear in the Events list as well as on the Feed page for any Feeds that are connected to your selected Slack channels.
Here is an example of how the event will look on the site:

### Save Draft

When you have completed the event information, press the "Save Draft" button to save your event.
You can return to it later to finish editing at any time.

### Publish Event / Submit for Approval

When you are ready to publish your event, first navigate to `My Drafts` on the Events panel.
On the overflow menu, you'll see the option to Publish Event.

- If you are an admin, you'll see the option to Publish Event.
- If you are a champion, you will see a "Submit for Approval" option.

### Approve Event (Admin Only)

If you are a champion, you will first need your event approved before it is published. Once approved, the event will be published to the channels you selected.

If you are an admin, you will see the event under the "Needs Approval" dropdown selection. If you go to the overflow menu, you can approve the event which will publish it immediately.

</Steps>

## Published Event Announcement

Your event will be announced on the channel(s) you selected. Congrats! ðŸŽ‰
