### Step 2

Select the `Home` tab at the top of the page.

### Step 4

Follow the onboarding instructions to create your community and configure some modules along the way.

Your Tightknit community represents the top-most umbrella module that includes all other modules, such as: the companion forums site, events, gamification etc.

</Steps>

## Companion Site Overview

As a part of the guided setup, you'll have the opportunity to spin up a [companion forums website](/companion-site/getting-started). You will be able to sync content from Slack to your site to serve as a landing page to the rest of the internet!

![New Tightknit companion site](/companion-site-screenshot.png)

This is a high-level outline of how you would sync content from Slack over to the companion site:

<Steps>

### Choose Your Slack Channel

Pick one of your Slack channels that will have its messages synced to a Feed
in the Tightknit companion site.

For example, let's say you have a `#help` channel and want to sync it to a Feed in the Tightknit companion site. Once you have completed all the steps in this guide, Tightknit will sync
new incoming Slack messages sent in `#help` as a post or comment in the site's "Help" Feed.

### Activate Tightknit in the Slack Channel

You must give the Tightknit app the permissions to access your channel.

If the channel is private, first add the Tightknit app as a member of the Slack channel. Then follow these
[instructions](/channels-and-feeds/activate-channel)
to allow Tightknit to see and manage the channel.

### Create the Tightknit Feed

Follow these
[instructions](/channels-and-feeds/create-feed)
to create a Tightknit Feed connected to the channel.

### Send Messages

This is the easy part. ‚úçÔ∏è Simply send messages within the Slack channel as normal, and
sit back and relax as you watch them automatically sync to your Tightknit companion site!
üíØ

<Callout>
  Tightknit will only start syncing Slack messages to the Tightknit companion
  site once a Feed has been created for the channel. Messages sent prior to the
  Feed creation date will not be synced, but if you want to sync specific older
  messages, you can certainly do so by using the [message
  shortcut](/shortcuts/message-shortcuts).
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Reinstalling the Slack App

In order to get the latest features from Tightknit, you may need to repeat
these steps to reinstall the app. This is a safe operation you can perform at any time and will not affect
your community data.

The re-install link will be displayed in a warning message at the top of your App Home if the app is out of date:
