# Getting Started

## Install the Slack App

Install the Tighknit Slack application into your Slack workspace using the link provided by your Tightknit representative.
If you do not have this link and are interested in Tightknit, [please reach out to the team](https://calendly.com/tightknitai/introductory-call).

Ensure your Slack workspace is currently selected by using the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.
Once you have reviewed the app permissions, click Allow.

  In order to get the latest features from Tightknit, you may need to repeat
  these steps to reinstall the app. This is a safe operation and will not affect
  your community.

## Create the Community

In Slack, find the Tightknit app under the Apps section in the sidebar.
If you don't see it, click "Add apps" and search for Tightknit.

Select the Home tab at the top of the page.

If you don't already have a community set up, you will see the "Create New Commmunity" button.
Click the button, and insert the name and URL slug for your site. Don't worry if you change your mind â€” you can always edit this later.

Tightknit will use the name, slug, and your current Slack workspace logo to create a brand new web commmunity!
