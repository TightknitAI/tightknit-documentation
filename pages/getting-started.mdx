# Getting Started

Setting up Tightknit is as easy as installing our app and clicking "Create". Building a community has never been easier!

## Install the Slack App

<Steps>
### Go to the Install Page

Install the Tightknit Slack app into your Slack workspace by visiting the installation link provided by your Tightknit representative.
If you are interested in Tightknit but do not have this link, please [reach out to the team](https://calendly.com/tightknitai/introductory-call).

<Callout type="info">
  Only Slack admins and authorized users are allowed to install apps in a

### Select Your Workspace

Ensure your Slack workspace is currently selected by using the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.

  your community data.

## Create the Community and Companion Site

### Step 3

If you don't already have a Tightknit companion site set up, you will see the `Create New Commmunity` button.

## Sync Content to the Tightknit Companion Site

You will now see all of your Tightknit companion site information and settings on the Home page of
the Tightknit app. Let's start syncing content from Slack over to the site! ‚úçÔ∏è

<Steps>

### Choose Your Slack Channel

Pick one of your Slack channels that will have its messages synced to a Feed
in the Tightknit companion site.

For example, let's say you have a `#help` channel and want to sync it to a Feed in the Tightknit companion site. Once you have completed all the steps in this guide, Tightknit will sync
new incoming Slack messages sent in `#help` as a post or comment in the site's "Help" Feed.

### Enable the Slack Channel as a Tightknit Feed

If the channel is private, first add the Tightknit app as a member of the Slack channel. Then follow these
[instructions](./slack-administration/channel-and-feed-settings.mdx#create-a-new-feed)
to create the Tightknit Feed in the app settings.

<Callout>
  Tightknit will only start syncing Slack messages to the Tightknit companion
  site once a Feed has been created for the channel. Messages sent prior to the
  Feed creation date will not be synced, but if you want to sync specific older
  messages, you can certainly do so by using the [message
  shortcut](./basics/message-shortcuts)!
</Callout>

### Send Messages

This is the easy part. Simply send messages within the Slack channel as normal, and
sit back and relax as you watch them automatically sync to your Tightknit companion site!
