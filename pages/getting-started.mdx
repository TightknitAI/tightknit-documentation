## Sync Content to the Web Community

You will now see all of your Tightknit Web Community's information and settings on the Home page of
the Tightknit app. Let's start syncing content from Slack over to the site! ‚úçÔ∏è

<Steps>

### Enable a Slack Channel as a Tightknit Feed

Pick one of your Slack channels that will have its messages synced to a Feed
in the Web Community.

For example, let's say you have a `#help` channel and want to sync it to a "Help"
feed in the Web Community. Once you have completed the following steps, Tightknit will sync
every new incoming Slack message sent in `#help` as a Post or Comment in the Web
Community "Help" feed.

First, add the Tightknit app as a member of the Slack channel. Then follow these
[instructions](./slack-administration/feed-settings.mdx#create-a-new-feed)
to create the Tightknit feed in the app settings.

<Callout>
  Tightknit will only start syncing Slack messages to the Web Community once the
  feed has been set up. Prior messages will not be synced, but if you want to
  sync specific older messages, you can certainly do so by using the [message
  shortcut](./basics/message-shortcuts.mdx)!
</Callout>

### Send Messages

This is the easy part. Simply send messages within the Slack channel as normal, and
sit back and relax as you watch them automatically sync to your Tightknit Web Community!
