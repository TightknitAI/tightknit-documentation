# Getting Started

Setting up Tightknit is as easy as installing our app and clicking "Create". Building a community has never been easier!

## Install the Slack App

<Steps>
### Go to the Install Page

Install the Tightknit Slack app into your Slack workspace by visiting the installation link provided by your Tightknit representative.
If you are interested in Tightknit but do not have this link, please [reach out to the team](https://calendly.com/tightknitai/introductory-call).

<Callout type="info">
  Only Slack admins and authorized users are allowed to install apps in a

### Select Your Workspace

Ensure your Slack workspace is currently selected by using the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.

## Create the Community

<Steps>
### Step 1

In Slack, find the Tightknit app under the Apps section in the sidebar.
If you don't see it, click `+ Add apps` and search for Tightknit.

### Step 2

Select the `Home` tab at the top of the page.

### Step 3

If you don't already have a Tightknit community site set up, you will see the `Create New Commmunity` button.
Click the button and the Create a Community modal will pop up. Insert the name and URL slug for your site. Don't worry ‚Äî you can always edit this later.

### Step 4

Last step: click `Create`. You now have a Tightknit community! ‚ú®

Your Tightknit community represents the top-most umbrella module that includes all other modules, such as: the companion forums site, events, gamification etc.

</Steps>

## (Optional) Sync Content to the Tightknit Companion Site

In the next step of the guided setup, you'll have the option to spin up your companion forums website. You will be able to sync content from Slack to your site to serve as a landing page to the rest of the internet!

Tightknit will use the provided name, slug, and your current Slack workspace logo to create your site.

You will now see all of your Tightknit companion site information and settings on the Home page of
the Tightknit app. Let's start syncing content from Slack over to the site! ‚úçÔ∏è

<Steps>

### Choose Your Slack Channel

Pick one of your Slack channels that will have its messages synced to a Feed
in the Tightknit companion site.

For example, let's say you have a `#help` channel and want to sync it to a Feed in the Tightknit companion site. Once you have completed all the steps in this guide, Tightknit will sync
new incoming Slack messages sent in `#help` as a post or comment in the site's "Help" Feed.

### Enable the Slack Channel as a Tightknit Feed

If the channel is private, first add the Tightknit app as a member of the Slack channel. Then follow these
[instructions](./slack-administration/channel-and-feed-settings.mdx#create-a-new-feed)
to create the Tightknit Feed in the app settings.

<Callout>
  Tightknit will only start syncing Slack messages to the Tightknit companion
  site once a Feed has been created for the channel. Messages sent prior to the
  Feed creation date will not be synced, but if you want to sync specific older
  messages, you can certainly do so by using the [message
  shortcut](./basics/message-shortcuts)!
</Callout>

### Send Messages

This is the easy part. Simply send messages within the Slack channel as normal, and
sit back and relax as you watch them automatically sync to your Tightknit companion site!
