# Profile

The **Profile detail page** shows the user's info and activity within the community.

Profile detail pages are found at the URL path `/user/<profile-id>`.
Note that the id belongs to the user's _Tightknit_ profile, not their Slack profile.

Admin users have `ADMIN` badge next to their name.
Users connected to Slack bots or apps will have an `APP` badge next to their name.

  profile. Please contact [support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) if you need a
  different name display style.

<Callout type="info">
  Profiles of bot users always display the full bot name and image from Slack.
