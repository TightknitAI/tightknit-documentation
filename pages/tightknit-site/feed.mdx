# Feed

The **Feed detail page** displays the sorted posts within that feed. They are connected to your Slack channels.

## Overview

Feed pages are found at the URL path `/x/<feed-slug>`.

### Unlisted Feeds

Unlisted feeds are only accessible by directly visiting the URL. They are excluded from sidebar links and SEO.

Posts from unlisted feeds will not appear in any other feeds, such as on the Home page or Profile page.

## "About" & "Topic" Section

Describes the purpose and topic of your feed. This section is linked to the `Description` and `Topic`, respectively, of your Slack channels
and will be updated automatically [when the channel is updated](../basics/how-items-sync.mdx).

![About section](/tightknit-site/about-section.png)

If either of these sections are empty, they are not shown on the page.

## Sorting

Use the feed sort select menu to choose the order the feed posts are displayed.

![Feed sort](/tightknit-site/sorting.png)

Depending on the feed type, you may see the following options:

- **Most Recent Activity** - the posts with the most recent comments are highest
- **Newest** - the posts created most recently are highest
- **Oldest** - the oldest posts are highest

User sorting preferences are remembered on a per feed basis.

## Display Settings

The default list view display setting is determined by the ["List View Display" setting in the admin feed settings](../slack-administration/feed-settings.mdx).

Users can also use the feed post display select menu to choose the format in which feed posts are displayed. User display setting preferences are remembered on a per feed basis.

### Snippet

Includes the body of the post, up to a certain length, and attachments.

### Subscribing in Slack

ðŸ’¡ Slack has a nifty tool to subscribe to RSS updates within a channel!

<Steps>

### Slack `feed` Command

Simply start typing a message in your channel and type `/feed <RSS-LINK>`,
where the RSS link is replaced with the link shown in the Tightknit RSS modal.

Once the command is entered, your slack channel will
now be notified every time there is a new post made in the Tightknit feed.
