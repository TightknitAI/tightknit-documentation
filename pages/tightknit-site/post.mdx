# Post

The **Post detail page** displays a post and comments from a community feed.
Posts are sourced from messages in Slack and are updated automatically [when the original message changes](../basics/how-items-sync.mdx).

Post detail pages are found at the URL path `/x/<feed-slug>/<post-id>/<post-slug>`.
Users will be redirected to this canonical url if the post slug in the URL is omitted or incorrect.

The Post detail page generally includes:

- an auto-generated title
- the author
- the posted date (respects the original Slack message send date)
- a permalink back to the original Slack message
- emoji reactions from the original Slack message
- all synced Comments on the post, with the above info on each comment

## Display Settings

The post detail display type is determined by the ["Post Detail Display" setting in the admin feed settings](../slack-administration/feed-settings.mdx).

### Discussion

The Discussion display is best suited for chats, FAQs, and traditional forum posts.

### Blog

The Blog display is best suited for blog posts, where the cover image should take front and center. The cover image is the first image file attachment on the associated Slack message, if any, and is not included in the attachments section if there are additional files.
