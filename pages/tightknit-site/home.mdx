# Home - Landing Page

The **Home page** of your site is a beautiful attention-grabbing landing page that encapsulates what your community is about and why they should join. It features:

- Hero banner image, with welcome message and community description
- Stats of the community: number of feeds, number of posts, number of members
- Join form (‚è≥ **_MORE FEATURES COMING SOON_**)
- Top members leaderboard
- Feeds list

  **Early Stage Communities** <br />
  Brand new communities don't need to worry about displaying potentially underwhelming
  metrics on the landing page. If they're under a certain threshold, we'll skip them.
  We've all got to start somewhere after all! Happy growing! üìà
