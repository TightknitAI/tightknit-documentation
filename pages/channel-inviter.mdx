# Channel Inviter

The **Channel Inviter** tool helps admins perform bulk invitations of users to a specific Slack channel. This is helpful for moving large numbers of users to new channels. Navigate to the channel which you want to invite users to, and type one of the following commands:

- `/invite-all` - invites all members of your entire Slack workspace to the current channel
- `/invite-channel` - invites all members of another specified channel to the current channel

You will be asked for confirmation before the bulk invites are sent.
