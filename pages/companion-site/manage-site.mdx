# Tightknit Companion Site Settings

These settings allow you to configure your community branding and how Tightknit interacts across your entire workspace.
You can find these settings in your Tightknit Slack app under the `Tightknit Companion Site` section.

By default, the site logo will be the same as your Slack workspace icon. If you require a different logo, please contact [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai).

## Site Details

Within the Site Details modal, you can configure the following:

- **Site Name** - This is the name of your site.
  This will be used as the title in the header of your Tightknit companion site as well as the title within SEO metadata.
- **Site Subdomain (URL)** - This is the subdomain that will be used when you host your site on `.tightknit.community`. The subdomain is not used if you register a custom domain.
  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If you're interested in using a custom domain, please reach out to
    [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) or ask for help within the Slack
    community.
  </Callout>
  <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    If not on a custom domain, updating a sites's slug will change the URL of
    all pages in the site. This will break any links that have been shared and
    may have a negative impact on SEO.
