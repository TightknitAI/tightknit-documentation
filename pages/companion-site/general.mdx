  This will be used as the title in the header of your Tightknit companion site as well as the title within SEO metadata.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you're interested in using a custom domain, please reach out to
  [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) or ask for help within the Slack
  community.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If not on a custom domain, updating a sites's slug will change the URL of all
  pages in the site. This will break any links that have been shared and may
  have a negative impact on SEO.
