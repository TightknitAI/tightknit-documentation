# Profile Fields

In the `Profile Fields` modal, you can configure which fields are displayed on the [member profile page](/companion-site/pages/profile).

![Tightknit Profile Fields Settings](/tightknit-site/profiles/profile-fields-modal.png)

These profile fields are populated from the Slack profile fields that are configured in the Slack workspace.
Only active profile fields will be displayed on the modal for selection.

You can configure these fields in the Slack workspace by going to `Customize Workspace` > `Profiles`.
