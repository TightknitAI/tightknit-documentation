# Profile Fields

In the `Profile Fields` modal, you can configure the visibility and privacy settings for fields displayed on the [member profile page](/companion-site/pages/profile).

Within the Profile Fields modal, you can configure:

- **Profile Fields: Public** - fields that are visible to all visitors of the companion site.
- **Profile Fields: Restricted to Members** - fields that are only visible to authenticated users (_coming soon_), and shows "🔒 Restricted to Members" to all other visitors. The name of the field (e.g. "Title") will be visible.

There cannot be overlapping fields between the Public and Restricted field sets.

These profile fields are populated from the profile fields that are configured in the Slack workspace.
Only active Slack profile fields are shown as options for Tightknit.

You can configure these fields in the Slack workspace by going to `Customize Workspace` > `Profiles`.
