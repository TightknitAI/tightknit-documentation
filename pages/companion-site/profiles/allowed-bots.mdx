# Allowed Bot Profiles

You can configure which bots are allowed to post into the Tightknit companion site by adding to the `Allowed Bot Profiles` modal, found under the **Profiles** module.

Up to three Slack bots can be configured to post to the Tightknit companion site. Please reach out to [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) if you need more.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only include bots in this dropdown. All real members are already allowed so no
  need to add them manually.
</Callout>

Additionally, you may configure:

- **Bot Profile Photo Override** - when enabled, the user profile photos for the allowed bots are replaced on the Companion Site with your [Companion Site Icon](/companion-site/site-images).
