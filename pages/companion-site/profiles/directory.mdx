# Directory Settings

You can access the settings for the [Directory page](/companion-site/pages/directory) by clicking the `Directory` button under the **Profiles** module.

Within the Directory Settings, you can configure:

- **Directory page** - enable or disable the Directory page. When disabled, the route will be removed from all navigation menus and will be removed from SEO.
- **Featured Members: Groups** - the [Group(s)](/community/groups) of community members that are featured on the directory. Each featured group is a sub-route of the directory route on the site.
