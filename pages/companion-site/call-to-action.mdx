# Call to Action Button

Within the Call-to-action Button settings modal, you can configure the following:

- **Call-to-Action Text** - This is the text that is present on the Slack button [across the Tightknit companion site experience](../tightknit-site/navbar-and-sidebar.mdx#call-to-action-button). If you do not wish to show this button, leave this field empty.
- **Call-to-Action URL** - This is the URL that the Slack button will link to when clicked. By default, it is the `/join` page of your community. We strongly recommend you keep this setting, since the `/join` URL will automatically redirect to your [Slack invite link](#slack-invite-link) and capture useful metrics.
