# Home

The **Home page** of your site encapsulates what your community is about and why users should join, while directing them immediately to relevant content. It features:

- Welcome message and community description
- Banner image
- Stats of the community: number of posts and number of members
- Mini-leaderboard
- Feeds Tile Menu list

  **Early Stage Communities** <br />
  Brand new communities don't need to worry about displaying potentially underwhelming
  stats, like `1 member`, on the Home page. If they're under a certain threshold,
  we'll skip them. We've all got to start somewhere after all. Happy growing! ðŸ“ˆ
