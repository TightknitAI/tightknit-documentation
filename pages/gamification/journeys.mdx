  Gamification is currently part of our pilot program. If you would like to

A **Journey** is a collection of [Milestones](#milestones). Members of the community must complete each Milestone in the Journey, in any order, to receive a reward.

Each Journey's availability to the community can be controlled by the Journey's **activation** status and **completion window**.

## Administration

Admin users can manage their Journeys and Journey settings under the **Gamification** section in the Tighktnit app home.

### Create a New Journey

To create a new Journey, click the `Journeys` button in the Gamification module to access the **Journeys List** panel.

![Journeys List Modal](/gamification/journeys/journeys-list-modal.png)

Click `+ Create Journey` button to access the Journey creation modal, where you can configure the following:

- **Name** - the name of the Journey
- **Completion Window** - the completion window is the interval of time during which members' actions will count towards completion of the Journey. Members can only complete Milestones and Journeys during this time.
  - **Start Date** - the starting date of when members' actions begin counting towards the Milestones in this Journey
  - **End Date** - the ending date of when members' actions stop counting towards the Milestones in this Journey. If left blank or no end date is set, the Journey completion window will be open indefinitely.
- **Badge Award (optional)** - when a member completes the Journey, they will be awarded the [Badge](/gamification/badges)
- **Activation** - the publication status of the Journey. Once a Journey is activated, it becomes visible and available to all members of the community. Members can only complete Milestones for a Journey if both: 1) the Journey is activated, and 2) the actions occur within the Journey's completion window.

<Callout type="warning">
  Modifying the Milestones of an active Journey is not recommended and can have
  unintended consequences. Members who have completed a Milestone or Journey
  will not lose their completion status, even if the criteria changes.
</Callout>

## Milestones

A **Milestone** is a certain goal or criteria that a member of the community can meet in order to receive a reward. Each Milestone is associated with a single parent Journey.

### Create a New Milestone For a Journey

To acccess Milestones for a Journey, click the [Manage Milestones](#manage-milestones) menu option from the **Journeys List** panel. Click `+ Create Milestone` button to access Milestone creation, where you can configure the following:

- **Name** - the name of the Milestone
- **Action** - the [action type](#action-types) of the Milestone
- **Count Threshold** - for supported action types, the Count Threshold is the number of actions the member must perform in order to complete the Milestone. For example, for the _"Post in channel"_ Milestone, setting the Count Threshold to 10 would mean the member must post 10 times in the channel to complete the Milestone. See [action types](#action-types).
- **Scope to: Slack Channel** - for supported action types, the actions can be scoped to a specific Slack channel. Corresponding actions by a member must occur in this channel to count towards completion of the Milestone.

| **Join the workspace**                                     | A user first joins the Slack workspace                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                       |

<Callout type="info">
  The "**Join the workspace**" Milestone [action
  type](/gamification/milestones#action-types) is always considered completed if
  it is part of a Journey, since it is implied that every user in the workspace
  has achieved this.
