  Gamification is currently part of our pilot program. If you would like to

A **Journey** is a collection of [Milestones](/gamification/milestones). Members of the community must complete each Milestone in the Journey, in any order, to receive a reward.

## Administration

Admin users can manage their Journeys and Journey settings under the **Gamification** section in the Tighktnit app home.

### Create a New Journey

To create a new Journey, click the `Journeys` button in the Gamification module to access the **Journeys List** panel.

Click `+ Create Journey` button to access the Journey creation modal, where you can configure the following:

- **Name** - the name of the Journey
- **Milestones** - the [Milestone(s)](/gamification/milestones) that comprise this Journey. Limit of 15 Milestones.
- **Badge Award (optional)** - when a member completes the Journey, they will be awarded the [Badge](/gamification/badges)

<Callout type="info">
  The "**Join the workspace**" Milestone [action
  type](/gamification/milestones#action-types) is always considered completed if
  it is part of a Journey, since it is implied that every user in the workspace
  has achieved this.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  At this time, you cannot edit the Milestones that are part of the Journey
  after the Journey is created.
