## Administration

Admin users can manage their Badges and Badge settings under the **Gamification** section in the Tighktnit app home.

### Create a New Badge

To create a new Badge, click the `Badges` button in the Gamification module to access the **Manage Badges** panel. This panel contains all Badges available in the community.

![Manage Badges Modal](/gamification/badges/manage-badges-modal.png)

Click `Create Badge` button to access the Badge creation modal, where you can configure the following:

- **Name** - the name of the Badge
- **Badge Image** - the image of the Badge
- **Badge Description** - the description of the Badge, such as its purpose and under which conditions it is awarded to a user
- **Default Award Message** - the default message included when the Badge is sent to a user; this can be overridden when the user is sending the Badge
- **Badge Frame (Image)** - the Badge frame overlay is an image that members can use to generate a framed profile photo once they have earned the Badge. Recommended format for Badge frame images is 512 x 512 px PNG files. The frame visual should be a square border with a transparent center. We recommend making all your Badge frames the same size and shape so that users can easily generate new frames repeatedly on top of their profile photos.

### Send a Badge

To give a Badge to a member of the community, you can click the `Give Badge` button under the **Gamification** section in the app home. Alternatively, you can find the Badge in the Manage Badges panel, click the menu button `•••`, and select the `Give badge` option.

From here you will be able to select the user(s) receiving the Badge and the message sent with the award.

#### Send a Test Badge

Want to test out what it's like to receieve a Badge yourself? No problem! In the Manage Badges panel, click the menu button `•••`, and select the `Send test badge to myself` option.

## Earned Badges

### Viewing My Badges

Use the global shortcut `/badges` to open to the **My Badges** modal. The shortcut option will appear as you type /badges into the search bar or any conversation message.

Alternatively, non-admin users can view the Badges they have earned under the **My Badges** section in the Tightknit app home.

### Receiving a Badge

When a user receives a Badge, they get a private notification message containing the user that sent the Badge (unless sent anonymously), the award message, the Badge image, and the description.

#### Generate a Framed Profile Photo

Badge recipients will have the option to generate a profile photo for any earned Badges that are configured with a frame image. When a user clicks the `Generate Profile Photo`, we generate a framed profile photo using their current photo overlaid with the Badge frame image.

We also generate a Badge award image that can be shared in a social media announcement.

#### Fixing Duplicate Badge Frame Profile Photos

We recommend making sure you have a fresh profile photo before generating a new one with a Badge frame. Otherwise, you could overlay one Badge-framed photo on top of another in a way that doesn't look very good! Don't worry - it's easy to fix.

Follow this [guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) to edit your Profile and upload a new profile photo using your original photo with no frame. Then try again!
