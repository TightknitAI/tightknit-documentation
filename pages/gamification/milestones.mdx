# Milestones

<Callout emoji="✈️">
  Gamification is currently part of our pilot program. If you would like to

A **Milestone** is a certain goal or criteria that a member of the community can meet in order to receive a reward.

## Administration

Admin users can manage their Milestones and Milestone settings under the **Gamification** section in the Tighktnit app home.

### Create a New Milestone

To create a new Milestone, click the `Milestones` button in the Gamification module to access the **Milestones List** panel.

![Milestone List Modal](/gamification/milestones/milestones-list-modal.png)

Click `+ Create Milestone` button to access the Milestone creation modal, where you can configure the following:

- **Name** - the name of the Milestone
- **Action** - the [action type](#action-types) of the Milestone
- **Count Threshold** - for supported action types, the Count Threshold is the number of actions the member must perform in order to complete the Milestone. For example, for the _"Post in channel"_ Milestone, setting the Count Threshold to 10 would mean the member must post 10 times in the channel to complete the Milestone. See [action types](#action-types).
- **Scope to: Slack Channel** - for supported action types, the actions can be scoped to a specific Slack channel. Corresponding actions by a member must occur in this channel to count towards completion of the Milestone.
- **Badge Award (optional)** - when a member completes the Milestone, they will be awarded the [Badge](/gamification/badges)

| **# of reactions received on own message (not from self)** | Reactions received on a user's message by another user, in a channel in which [Tightknit is activated](/channels-and-feeds/activate-channel).    | Counted per number of reactions received                                                                                              |
| **# of messages reacted to (not to self)**                 | A user adds at least 1 reaction to another user's message, in a channel in which [Tightknit is activated](/channels-and-feeds/activate-channel). | Counter per number of unique messages reacted to (i.e. additional reactions on the _same_ message do not count towards the Milestone) |
| **Join the workspace**                                     | A user first joins the Slack workspace                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                       |

## Completing Milestones

When a member meets the conditions required to complete a Milestone in the community, they will receive a private notification along with the award Badge, if any is configured.
