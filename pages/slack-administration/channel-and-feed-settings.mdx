# Channel & Feed Settings

To give the app permissions to add features to your Slack channel, you must first **enable the channel for Tightknit**. This will unlock community management features for the channel, as well as allow you to connect a **Feed**.

**[Feeds](../tightknit-site/feed)** are the backbone of all posts in your companion site.
Each Feed is configured to monitor your Slack channel to control when and how messages are posted to the site. Feeds can be created, edited, and unlisted from the app settings. You can find these settings in your Tightknit Slack app under the `Channels & Feeds` section.

## Enable a Channel for Tightknit

To enable one of your Slack channels to work with Tightknit, click the `Enable Channel for Tightknit` button within the Channels & Feeds settings section.

<Callout type="info">
  The Tightknit app must be within the Slack channel to sync posts to the Feed.
  You must add the app to private channels. You can do this either by tagging it
  in a message with an @mention, or through channel settings:
  <br /> 1. Open the Slack channel <br /> 2. Click on the channel name at the top
  of the page to open the channel details <br /> 3. Click on the `Integrations` tab
  <br /> 4. In the Apps section, click `Add apps` <br /> 5. Add the Tightknit
  app
</Callout>

Once you have enabled a channel, it will appear under the `Channels & Feeds` section. At the end of the row will be an overflow menu button `•••` with three dots, used to access the channel and Feed settings:

## Create a new Feed

<Callout type="info">
  The Tightknit companion site is required to create Feeds.
</Callout>

To create a Tightknit Feed that is connected to an enabled Slack channel, click the `Create Tightknit Feed` option within the row-level menu of the channel settings.

![Create a new Feed](/slack-administration/channel-overflow-menu.png)

This will open a modal where you can enter the details of your new Feed.
Here, you will need to choose:

- **Selected Channel** - The channel that this Feed will listen to for new messages.
- **Feed Name** - The name of the Feed. This will be used to identify the Feed in the Feeds section on the Tightknit companion site.
- **Feed Slug** - The slug of the Feed. This will be used in the URL of the Feed. Try to keep this short and simple and something that will change infrequently.
- **Preset** - The Tightknit companion site UI display preset for the Feed. This is used during Feed creation to determine default values for display settings such as List View Display and Post Detail Display. The display values can be overridden in the optional settings below.

Additional optional settings:

- **Message Sync Settings** - By default, Tightknit will sync all incoming new Slack messages and replies to the Feed. If you do _not_ want to auto-sync messages (e.g., you prefer to manually sync select posts using the [shortcut](../basics/message-shortcuts#tightknit-shortcuts)), uncheck this option.
- **Tightknit Responder** - By default, the Tightknit bot will send a public reply on every synced Slack message to notify the user(s) that the thread is now synced to the companion site. You can mute the Tightknit responder to turn off this feature.

  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    When the Tightknit responder is muted, users will still see ephemeral
    messages when they perform an action using a [Tightknit
    shortcut](../basics/message-shortcuts#tightknit-shortcuts).
  </Callout>

- **Emoji Icon** - The emoji icon, such as 📡, that is displayed next to the Feed name in the Tightknit companion site sidebar using the [Noto Emoji Google font](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji). If none is set, the sidebar displays a default icon.
  <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    The Noto Emoji Google font has limited support across browsers. It is a good
    idea to check your choice of emoji in the [Noto Emoji Type
    tester](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji/tester) within the
    major browsers.
  </Callout>
- **Make Feed unlisted** - Feeds that are unlisted are excluded from sidebar links and SEO, and are only accessible by directly visiting the URL.
- **List View Display** - The default display setting for posts in the Feed list view, such as Snippet, Compact, or Card. [Read more](../tightknit-site/feed.mdx#display-settings).
- **Post Detail Display** - The default display setting for the detail page of posts in this Feed, such as Discussion or Blog. [Read more](../tightknit-site/post.mdx#display-settings).

Once you have entered the details of your new Feed, click the `Create` button to create the Feed.

![Feed Create Modal](/slack-administration/feed-create-modal.png)

<Callout>
  You can create a max of 2 Feeds per Slack workspace. If you need more Feeds,
  please contact [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai).
</Callout>

## Update an existing Feed

### Edit Feed

To edit an existing Feed, click the `Edit Feed settings` option within the row-level menu.

![Edit Feed](/slack-administration/feed-overflow-menu.png)

In the Update Feed modal, you'll be able to edit the same values as the [Feed creation settings](#create-a-new-feed).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Updating a Feed's slug will change the URL of the Feed. This will break any
  links to the Feed that have been shared.
</Callout>

### Sync Channel Info

The [Feed detail page](../tightknit-site/feed) features the corresponding Slack channel's topic, description, and other metadata. This information is typically synced to the site automatically. However, if you find the site has not been updated, you can trigger a sync manually by clicking the `🔄 Sync channel info` option within the row-level menu.

This action is will only sync channel metadata. It will not sync any of the Slack messages.
