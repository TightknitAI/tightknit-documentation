# Tightknit Site Settings

These settings allow you to configure your community branding and how Tightknit interacts across your entire workspace.
You can find these settings in your Tightknit Slack Application under the `Tightknit Site` section.

![Tightknit Site Settings Section](/slack-administration/site-settings.png)

By default, the site logo will be the same as your Slack workspace icon. If you require a different logo, please contact [support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai).

## Site Details

Within the Site Details modal, you can configure the following:

- **Community Name** - This is the name of your community.
  This will be used as the title of your Tightknit site as well as the title within SEO metadata.
- **Site Slug** - This is the subdomain that will be used when you host your community on `tightknit.community`.
  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If you're interested in using a custom domain, please reach out to
    [support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) or ask for help within the Slack
    community.
  </Callout>
  <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    If not on a custom domain, updating a sites's slug will change the URL of
    all community pages that use this slug. This will break any links that have
    been shared.
  </Callout>

## Site Settings

Within the Site Settings modal, you can configure the following:

- **Call-to-Action Text** - This is the text that is present on the Slack button [across the Tightknit site experience](../tightknit-site/navbar-and-sidebar.mdx#call-to-action-button). If you do not wish to show this button, leave this field empty.
- **Call-to-Action URL** - This is the URL that the Slack button will link to when clicked. By default, it is the `/join` page of your community. We strongly recommend you keep this setting, since the `/join` URL will automatically redirect to your [Slack invite link](#slack-invite-link) and capture useful metrics.

## Slack Invite Link

Within the Slack Invite Link modal, you can register your Slack workspace's shared invitation link with Tightknit. You can find your invite link [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#share-an-invitation-link).

Once you've registered your invite link with Tightknit, we recommend _never_ directly using that link anymore and instead using the `/join` URL of your Tightknit site. Why? Our URL will never change, and as it sends users to your Slack invite link, we'll keep track of who uses it to join your workspace!

<Callout type="info">
  Each admin user in the workspace can generate their own unique shared invite
  link. You can register any of those links with Tightknit.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  A Slack invitation link expires after it is used for 400 successful sign-ups.
  You must then [generate a new link](#generate-a-new-invite-link) and register
  it again with Tightknit. Don't worry - we'll remind you when you're nearing
  the limit!
</Callout>

### Generate a new invite link

Is your link expired or expiring? Go into your Slack workspace admin settings. Select the "Invitations" page under the administration menu, i.e. the URL is at `/admin/invites`. Click on the "Invite Links" tab. Find the user whose link was registered with Tightknit and click "Deactivate".

Now simply [repeat the process to generate an invite link](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#share-an-invitation-link). Don't forget to register again it with Tightknit!

## Home Page

Within the Home Page modal, you can configure the experience of the [Home page](../tightknit-site/home) of your site, including:

- **Community Description** - This is the subtitle underneath the community name.
- **Banner Image** - The image banner at the top of the Home page. For the best results, please use a dark image with dimensions of at least 970 x 90. Very tall images may be clipped.

## Integrations

Within the Integrations modal, you can configure Google Tag Manager.

Google Tag Manager is a free tool that allows you to manage and deploy marketing tags (snippets of code or tracking pixels) on your website without having to modify the code.
