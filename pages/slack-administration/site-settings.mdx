# Tightknit Companion Site Settings

These settings allow you to configure your community branding and how Tightknit interacts across your entire workspace.
You can find these settings in your Tightknit Slack app under the `Tightknit Companion Site` section.

By default, the site logo will be the same as your Slack workspace icon. If you require a different logo, please contact [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai).

## Site Details

Within the Site Details modal, you can configure the following:

- **Community Name** - This is the name of your community.
  This will be used as the title of your Tightknit companion site as well as the title within SEO metadata.
- **Site Slug** - This is the subdomain that will be used when you host your community on `tightknit.community`.
  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If you're interested in using a custom domain, please reach out to
    [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) or ask for help within the Slack
    community.
  </Callout>
  <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    If not on a custom domain, updating a sites's slug will change the URL of
    all community pages that use this slug. This will break any links that have
    been shared.

## Call to Action Button

Within the Call to Action Button settings modal, you can configure the following:

- **Call-to-Action Text** - This is the text that is present on the Slack button [across the Tightknit companion site experience](../tightknit-site/navbar-and-sidebar.mdx#call-to-action-button). If you do not wish to show this button, leave this field empty.
- **Call-to-Action URL** - This is the URL that the Slack button will link to when clicked. By default, it is the `/join` page of your community. We strongly recommend you keep this setting, since the `/join` URL will automatically redirect to your [Slack invite link](#slack-invite-link) and capture useful metrics.

## Home Page

Within the Home Page modal, you can configure the experience of the [Home page](../tightknit-site/home) of your site, including:

- **Community Description** - This is the subtitle underneath the community name.
- **Banner Image** - The image banner at the top of the Home page. For the best results, please use an image with dimensions of at least 827 x 192. Very tall images may be clipped.
