## Community Settings

Within the Community Settings modal, you can configure the following:

- **Call-to-Action Text** - This is the text that is present on the Slack button across the Tightknit Web Community experience.
- **Call-to-Action URL** - This is the URL that the Slack button will redirect to when clicked.
- **Quiet Mode** - When this setting is off, Tightknit will send a message as a thread for every message that has been posted in an activated channel.
  When this setting is on, Tightknit will never send any standard messages.
