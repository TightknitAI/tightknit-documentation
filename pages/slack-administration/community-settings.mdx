# Community Settings

These settings allow you to configure your Tightknit app and how it interacts across your entire Slack workspace.
You can find these settings in your Tightknit Slack Application under the `Community` section.

## Community Details

Within the Community Details modal, you can configure the following:

- **Community Name** - This is the name of your community.
  This will be used as the title of your Tightknit site, as well as the title within SEO metadata. It also used as the name of the Tightknit app bot when it responds to Slack messages.
- **Site Slug** - This is the subdomain that will be used when you host your community on `tightknit.community`.
  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If you're interested in using a custom domain, please reach out to
    [support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) or ask for help within the Slack
    community.
  </Callout>
  <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    If not on a custom domain, updating a sites's slug will change the URL of
    all community pages that use this slug. This will break any bookmarks and
    links that have been shared.

## Community Settings

Within the Community Settings modal, you can configure the following:

- **Quiet Mode** - When this setting is off, Tightknit will send a message as a thread for every message that has been posted in an activated channel.
  When this setting is on, Tightknit will never send any standard messages.

  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    In quiet mode, users will continue to see ephemeral messages when they
    perform an action using a Tightknit shortcut.
  </Callout>

## Hub Channel

When you first set up your Tightknit community, we will create a private channel called **`tightknit-hub`** for notifications and triage.

We will send important analytics, updates, and alerts about your community here. This is a private channel that should only include select admins.
