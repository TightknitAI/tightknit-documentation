# Feed Settings

Feeds are the backbone of all community posts.
Each feed correlates with a channel to control how and when messages are posted to the channel.
Feeds can be created, edited, and unlisted from the Feed Settings page.

## Create a new Feed

To create a new feed, click the `Create Feed` button within the Feeds section.

![Create a new Feed Button](/FeedCreateButton.png)

This will open a modal where you can enter the details of your new feed.
Here you will need to choose:

- **Selected Channel** - The channel that this feed will listen to for new messages.
- **Feed Name** - The name of the feed. This will be used to identify the feed in the Feeds section on the Tightknit site.
- **Feed Slug** - The slug of the feed. This will be used in the URL of the feed. Try to keep this short and simple and something that will change infrequently.
- **Preset** - The Tightknit site UI display preset for the feed. This is used during feed creation to determine default values for display settings such as List View Display and Post Detail Display. The display values can be overridden in the optional settings below.

Additional optional settings:

- **Emoji Icon** - The emoji icon, such as 📡, that is displayed next to the feed name in the Tightknit site sidebar. If none is set, the sidebar displays a default icon.
- **Make feed unlisted** - Feeds that are unlisted are excluded from sidebar links and SEO, and are only accessible by directly visiting the URL.
- **List View Display** - The default display setting for posts in the feed list view, such as Snippet, Compact, or Card. [Read More](../tightknit-site/feed.mdx#display-settings).
- **Post Detail Display** - The default display setting for the detail page of posts in this feed, such as Discussion or Blog. [Read More](../tightknit-site/post.mdx#display-settings).

Once you have entered the details of your new feed, click the `Create` button to create the feed.

  Updating a feed's slug will change the URL of the feed. This will break any
  links to the feed that have been shared.
