# Feed Settings

Feeds are the backbone of all community posts.
Each feed correlates with a channel to control how and when messages are posted to the channel.
Feeds can be created, edited, and unlisted from the Feed Settings page.

## Create a new Feed

To create a new feed, click the `Create Feed` button within the Feeds section.

This will open a modal where you can enter the details of your new feed.
Here you will need to choose:

- **Selected Channel** - The channel that this feed will listen to for new messages.
- **Feed Name** - The name of the feed. This will be used to identify the feed in the Feeds section on the Web Community.
- **Feed Slug** - The slug of the feed. This will be used in the URL of the feed. Try to keep this short and simple and something that will change infrequently.

Once you have entered the details of your new feed, click the `Create` button to create the feed.

### Edit Feed

To edit an existing feed, click the `Edit` button within the Feeds Edit Menu.

In the new modal, you'll be able to edit the following:

- **Feed Name** - The name of the feed. This will be used to identify the feed in the Feeds section on the Web Community.
- **Feed Slug** - The slug of the feed. This will be used in the URL of the feed. Try to keep this short and simple and something that will change infrequently.

  Updating a feed's slug will change the URL of the feed. This will break any
  links to the feed that have been shared.
