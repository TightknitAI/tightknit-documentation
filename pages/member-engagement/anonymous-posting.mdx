# Anonymous Posting

Let your members send anonymous messages in specified channels. In the chat or search bar, any user can type the `/anonymous` command to get started. You may optionally include a message after the command, such as `/anonymous Your message goes here`, and then press Enter.

<Callout>
  Tightknit does NOT store or expose the author's identity anywhere.

## Sending an anonymous message

<Callout type="info">
  Members may only send anonymous messages within Slack channels that have
  anonymous posting enabled.
</Callout>

Users can type the `/anonymous` command into the chat to access the **Anonymous Message** panel, which allows them to format and send their message to any channel with anonymous posting enabled.

The resulting message will be posted in the channel as the Tightknit app in "anonymous" mode.
