# New Member Onboarding

Within the New Member Onboarding modal, you can configure the following:

- **Welcome Message** - When new users join your workspace, Tightknit can send them a customized welcome message introducing them to your community's guidelines, your workspace's most important channels, or general tips for getting started. Not sure what your message will look like? Try it out safely, and send a test message to yourself!

- **Community Guidelines Link** - A link to your community guidelines, included as a button attached to the end of your onboarding welcome message. We recommend using the URL of the [Community Guidelines page](/companion-site/pages/community-guidelines) on your companion site, if you have configured one.
