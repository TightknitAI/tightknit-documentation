# Slash Commands

Use Tightknit's [slash commands](https://slack.com/help/articles/360057554553-Use-shortcuts-to-take-actions-in-Slack) to take actions related to your community in Slack. For example, the Channel Inviter is a powerful productivity tool that allows you to invite large numbers of users to new Slack channels

## How to Access Slash Commands in Slack

As the name suggests, slash commands can be accessed simply by typing slash `/` in the chat, followed by the name of the command and the command inputs (if applicable).

  The channel in which you type the command is often relevant to the action, so
  take note of where you're typing!
