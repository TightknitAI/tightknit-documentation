# Activate Channel for Tightknit

To give the app permissions to add features to your Slack channel, you must first **activate the channel for Tightknit**. This will unlock community management features for the channel, as well as allow you to connect a **[Feed](/channels-and-feeds/create-feed)**.

## Activate a Channel for Tightknit

To activate one of your Slack channels to work with Tightknit, click the `Activate Channel` button within the **Channels & Feeds** settings section.

<Callout type="info">
  The Tightknit app must be within the Slack channel to sync posts to the Feed.
  You must add the app to private channels. You can do this either by tagging it
  in a message with an @mention, or through channel settings:
  <br /> 1. Open the Slack channel <br /> 2. Click on the channel name at the top
  of the page to open the channel details <br /> 3. Click on the `Integrations` tab
  <br /> 4. In the Apps section, click `Add apps` <br /> 5. Add the Tightknit
  app
</Callout>

Once you have activated a channel, it will appear under the `Channels & Feeds` section. At the end of the row will be an overflow menu button `•••` with three dots, used to access the channel and Feed settings:

### Deactivate Tightknit within Channel

<Callout type="info">
  If the Slack channel is connected to an active Feed, you must first archive
  the Feed before deactivating the channel.
</Callout>

To deactivate the Tightknit app within one of your activated Slack channels, select the `Deactivate Channel` option within the `•••` dropdown menu for the channel. The app will no longer be integrated in this channel, and Tightknit features will not be available. The channel will no longer count toward your Tightknit-activated channels limit. Deactivation is solely related to Tightknit and has no other effect on the functioning of the Slack channel itself.

To re-activate a channel, simply repeat the steps above to [activate the channel for Tightknit](/channels-and-feeds/activate-channel).
