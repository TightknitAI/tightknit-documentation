# Getting Started

To give the app permissions to view and manage your Slack channels, you must first **activate the channel for Tightknit**. This will unlock community management features for the channel, as well as allow you to connect a Feed.

You can find your channel and Feed settings under the **Channels & Feeds** module in the app home.
