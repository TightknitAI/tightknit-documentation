# Getting Started

Manage channel-level features and connect your Slack channels to feeds in the Companion Site. To give the app permissions to view and manage your Slack channels, you must first **activate the channel for Tightknit**. This will unlock community management features for the channel, as well as allow you to connect a Feed.

## The Channels & Feeds Module

You can find your channel and Feed settings under the **Channels & Feeds** module in the App Home.
