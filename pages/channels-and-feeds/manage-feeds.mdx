## Managing Feeds

### Update an Existing Feed

To edit an existing Feed, click the `Feed Settings` option within the `•••` dropdown menu.

In the Update Feed modal, you'll be able to edit the same values as the [Feed creation settings](/channels-and-feeds/create-feed).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Updating a Feed's slug will change the URL of the Feed. This will break any
  links to the Feed that have been shared and may negatively impact SEO.
</Callout>

### Archive Feed

To archive a Feed, select the `Archive Feed` option within the `•••` dropdown menu for an active Feed. Archived Feeds are no longer active and will no longer sync content from Slack to the Companion Site. Archived Feeds do not count towards your active Feeds limit.

To un-archive a Feed, select the `Unarchive Feed` option within the `•••` dropdown menu for an archived Feed. You can only unarchive a Feed if you are within your active Feeds limit.
