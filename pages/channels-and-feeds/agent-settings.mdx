## Agents

The following Agents are available for each channel:

- Post Sync Reminder Agent
- Related Discussions Agent [✨AI]
- AI Answers Agent [✨AI] (_coming soon!_)

### Post Sync Reminder Agent

When a message is synced to the Companion Site as a post, the **Post Sync Reminder Agent** adds a reply to the thread with a link to the post and a reminder that all further replies are synced to the site.

### Related Discussions Agent

Each time a message is sent, our Tightknit AI finds other related messages within the same channel, and the **Related Discussions Agent** replies with links to the discussions. If the related message has been synced to the Companion Site, the result is linked to the URL of the post on the site; otherwise, it is linked to the Slack message directly.

You can customize the text of the message sent by the agent that precedes the results. In the example below, the preface text is "_▶︎ Related Discussions_".
