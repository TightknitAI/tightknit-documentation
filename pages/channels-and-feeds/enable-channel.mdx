### Sync Channel Info

The [Feed detail page](../tightknit-site/feed) features information from the corresponding Slack channel, including the topic, description, and other metadata. This information is typically synced to the site automatically. However, if you find the site has not been updated you can trigger a manual sync by clicking the `ðŸ”„ Sync channel info` option within the row-level menu.

This action is will only sync channel metadata. It will not sync any of the Slack messages.
