# Feed

The **Feed detail page** displays the sorted posts within that feed. They are connected to your Slack channels.

## Overview

Feed pages are found at the URL path `/x/<feed-slug>`.

### Unlisted Feeds

Unlisted feeds are only accessible by directly visiting the URL. They are excluded from sidebar links and SEO.

Posts from unlisted feeds will not appear in any other feeds, such as on the Home page or Profile page.

## "About" & "Topic" Section

Describes the purpose and topic of your feed. This section is linked to the `Description` and `Topic`, respectively, of your Slack channels
and will be updated automatically [when the channel is updated](../basics/how-items-sync.mdx).

![About section](/web-community/about-section.png)

If either of these sections are empty, they are not shown on the page.

## Sorting

Use the feed sort select menu to choose the order the feed posts are displayed.

- **Newest** - the posts created most recently are highest
- **Oldest** - the oldest posts are highest

User sorting preferences are remembered on a per feed basis.

## Display Settings
