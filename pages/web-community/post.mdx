# Post

The **Post detail page** displays a post and comments from a community feed.
Posts are sourced from messages in Slack and are updated automatically [when the original message changes](../basics/how-items-sync.mdx).

Post detail pages are found at the URL path `/x/<feed-slug>/<post-id>/<post-slug>`.
Users will be redirected to this canonical url if the post slug in the URL is omitted or incorrect.

The Post detail page includes:

- an auto-generated title
- the author
- the posted date (respects the original Slack message send date)
- a permalink back to the original Slack message
- emoji reactions from the original Slack message
- all synced Comments on the post, with the above info on each comment
