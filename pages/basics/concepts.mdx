# Concepts

Tightknit creates an intuitive mapping of the information in your Slack workspace to the features of your Tightknit community and companion site.

First, let's review some [Slack message terminology](https://api.slack.com/messaging/managing#threading):

> • Before a message has any replies, we call it an **unthreaded message**.<br/>
> • Once a message has replies, it becomes a **parent message**.<br/>
> • Any child messages of that parent message are called **threaded replies**.<br/>
> • The whole bundle of the parent message and replies is referred to as a **thread**.<br/>
> • Each of the messages within a thread, whether parent or reply, is a **threaded message**.<br/>

We like to call the concepts on the Slack side of things, such as messages and channels, **Slack-isms**.
So how do we create community features from Slack-isms? Check out this table:

| **Slack-ism**      | **Tightknit Community Feature** |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Workspace          | Community                       |
| Channel            | Feed                            |
| Message (_parent_) | Post                            |
| Threaded reply     | Comment                         |
