# Working With File Attachments

## Upload a File

Files up to 5 MB in size that are attached to Slack messages will be synced to the web community.
They will appear as attachments on the corresponding Post or Comment.

## Delete a File

When the message a file is attached to is deleted in Slack, or is removed from the web community using the message shortcut,
the file is also removed from the web community.

You may also use the `Delete file` action in Slack. This action will only delete the file in Slack and in the web community, and the post/comment will be preserved.
