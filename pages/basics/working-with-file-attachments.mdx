# Working With File Attachments

## Upload a File

Files up to 5 MB in size that are attached to Slack messages will be synced to the Tightknit companion site.
They will appear as attachments on the corresponding Post or Comment.

</Callout>

### Blog Cover Images

For Feeds that are configured to display [posts as "Blogs"](../tightknit-site/post#blog), the cover image used is the first image file attachment on the Slack message, if any.

## Delete a File

When the message a file is attached to is deleted in Slack, or is removed from the Tightknit companion site using the message shortcut,
the file is also removed from the Tightknit companion site.

You may also use the `Delete file` action in Slack. This action will only delete the file in Slack and in the Tightknit companion site, and the post/comment will be preserved.
