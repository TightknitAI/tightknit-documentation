# Create a Post or Comment

Creating new content in your community is as simple as sending messages in Slack!

## Posts

Once a Slack channel has been connected to a Tightknit feed, all new messages sent within that channel
are synced to the community as **Posts**.

Our Slack bot will reply with a notification that your post is now synced and link to the post in the community.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  The bot notification in Slack will be a non-public ephemeral message if Quiet
  Mode is enabled.
</Callout>

The community post will respect the posted date of the original Slack message. All posts contain a permalink back to the original Slack message.

### Title & Slug

The post title and URL slug are automatically generated using AI.
If you prefer a different title or slug, [you can edit it using the message shortcut](./edit-post-or-comment.mdx).

## Comments

Any replies on a synced Slack message are synced to the community as **Comments** on the Post.

The community comment will respect the posted date of the original Slack message. All comments contain a permalink back to the original Slack message.

<Callout>
  Tightknit treats all top-level Slack messages as posts in the community and
  all replies as comments. When responding to someone in a Slack channel, it is
  best practice to always reply in the message thread. Otherwise, consecutive
  top-level messages will each create distinct posts without context of each
  other.

## Message Shortcut - Sync a Message to the Community

Let's say you have a Slack message that is not synced to the community. Perhaps it is a message sent prior
to your Tightknit installation date; or it was previously synced but a user removed it from the community using the message shortcut.

You can simply re-sync it to the community using the Tightknit [message shortcut](../message-shortcuts.mdx).

<Callout>
  Using the message shortcut will sync the entire message thread at once,
  including the post, any of its commments, file attachments, emoji reactions,
  etc.
</Callout>

## @Mentions and Tags

Tightknit will convert most @mention and tags within the body of a message to the community equivalent link.
