# Create a Post or Comment

Creating new content in your Tightknit companion site is as simple as sending messages in Slack!

## Posts

Once a Slack channel has been connected to a Tightknit Feed, all new messages sent within that channel
are synced to the Tightknit companion site as **[posts](/companion-site/pages/post)**.

<Callout type="info">
  You can enable the **New Post Notification Agent** in a Slack channel [Agent
  Settings](/channels-and-feeds/agent-settings) in order to automatically get
  reminders when each message is synced to the site (_featured below_).
</Callout>

![New community post](/basics/new-post.png)

The Tightknit companion site post will respect the posted date of the original Slack message. All posts contain a permalink back to the original Slack message.

### Title and Slug

The post title and URL slug are automatically generated using AI.
If you prefer a different title or slug, you can edit it using the [message shortcut](/shortcuts/message-shortcuts#tightknit-shortcuts).

## Comments

Any replies on a synced Slack message are synced to the Tightknit companion site as **comments** on the post.

![New Slack reply](/basics/new-slack-reply.png)

![New community comment](/basics/new-comment.png)

The Tightknit companion site comment will respect the posted date of the original Slack message. All comments contain a permalink back to the original Slack message.

<Callout>
  Tightknit treats all top-level Slack messages as posts in the Tightknit
  companion site and all replies as comments. When responding to someone in a
  Slack channel, it is recommended to always reply in the message thread.
  Otherwise, consecutive top-level messages will each create distinct posts in
  the Tightknit companion site without context of each other.
</Callout>

## Message Shortcut: Sync a Message to the Tightknit Companion Site

Let's say you have a Slack message that is not synced to the Tightknit companion site. Perhaps it is a message sent prior
to your Tightknit installation date, or maybe it was previously synced but a user removed it from the Tightknit companion site using the message shortcut.

You can simply re-sync it to the Tightknit companion site using the Tightknit [message shortcut](/shortcuts-and-commands/message-shortcuts#tightknit-shortcuts).

<Callout>
  Using the message shortcut will sync the entire message thread at once,
  including the post, commments, file attachments, emoji reactions, etc.
</Callout>

## @Mentions and Tags

Tightknit will convert most @mention and tags within the body of a message to the equivalent name and link within the Tightknit companion site.

| **Slack @mention**                   | **Tightknit display text**                                                                                                                                                 | **Tightknit link** |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| @User                                | By default, uses the Slack profile full name. Please contact [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) if you need a different name display style.                            | User profile page  |
| #Channel                             | â€¢ If channel has connected Feed: Feed name<br/>â€¢ If no connected Feed: channel name (text only, no link)<br/>â€¢ If private channel: `ðŸ”’[private feed]` (text only, no link) | Feed page          |
| @User group                          | Name of group (text only, no link)                                                                                                                                         |                    |
| @here,<br/> @channel,<br/> @everyone | Text only, no link                                                                                                                                                         |                    |

User and Channel tags in Tightknit companion site content will be dynamically updated if the associated name changes in Slack.

## Messages from Bot Users

Posts and comments by bot users will only be synced to the Tightknit companion site if the bot user has been [configured to allow posting in the Feed](/companion-site/profiles/allowed-bots).
