# Create a Post or Comment

Creating new content in your Tightknit companion site is as simple as sending messages in Slack!

## Posts

Once a Slack channel has been connected to a Tightknit Feed, all new messages sent within that channel
are synced to the Tightknit companion site as **[posts](../../tightknit-site/post)**.

The Tightknit bot will respond with a notification that your post is now synced and link to the post in the Tightknit companion site. _This feature can be disabled in [Feed settings](../../slack-administration/channel-and-feed-settings)_.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  The bot notification in Slack will be a non-public ephemeral message if Quiet
  Mode is enabled.
</Callout>

The Tightknit companion site post will respect the posted date of the original Slack message. All posts contain a permalink back to the original Slack message.

### Title and Slug

The post title and URL slug are automatically generated using AI.
If you prefer a different title or slug, [you can edit it using the message shortcut](./edit-post-or-comment).

## Comments

Any replies on a synced Slack message are synced to the Tightknit companion site as **comments** on the post.

![New community comment](/new-comment.png)

The Tightknit companion site comment will respect the posted date of the original Slack message. All comments contain a permalink back to the original Slack message.

<Callout>
  Tightknit treats all top-level Slack messages as posts in the Tightknit
  companion site and all replies as comments. When responding to someone in a
  Slack channel, it is recommended to always reply in the message thread.
  Otherwise, consecutive top-level messages will each create distinct posts in
  the Tightknit companion site without context of each other.
</Callout>

## Message Shortcut: Sync a Message to the Tightknit Companion Site

Let's say you have a Slack message that is not synced to the Tightknit companion site. Perhaps it is a message sent prior
to your Tightknit installation date, or maybe it was previously synced but a user removed it from the Tightknit companion site using the message shortcut.

You can simply re-sync it to the Tightknit companion site using the Tightknit [message shortcut](../message-shortcuts).

<Callout>
  Using the message shortcut will sync the entire message thread at once,
  including the post, commments, file attachments, emoji reactions, etc.
</Callout>

## @Mentions and Tags

Tightknit will convert most @mention and tags within the body of a message to the equivalent name and link within the Tightknit companion site.

| **Slack @mention**                   | **Tightknit display text**                                                                                                                                                 | **Tightknit link** |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| @User                                | By default, uses the Slack profile full name. Please contact [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai) if you need a different name display style.                            | User profile page  |
| #Channel                             | • If channel has connected Feed: Feed name<br/>• If no connected Feed: channel name (text only, no link)<br/>• If private channel: `🔒[private feed]` (text only, no link) | Feed page          |
| @User group                          | Name of group (text only, no link)                                                                                                                                         |                    |
| @here,<br/> @channel,<br/> @everyone | Text only, no link                                                                                                                                                         |                    |

User and Channel tags in Tightknit companion site content will be dynamically updated if the associated name changes in Slack.

|                   Slack Message                   |                      Tightknit Post                       |

## Messages from Bot Users

Posts and comments by bot users will only be synced to the Tightknit companion site if the bot user has been [configured to allow posting in the Feed](../../slack-administration/manage-feed).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Known Limitation**: Slack bots that send _only_ Block Kit UI for their
  messages are not supported. Tightknit will only sync the `text` of a Slack
  message. If you are seeing issues with bot messages in your Tightknit
  companion site, please contact [Support](mailto:support@tightknit.ai).
</Callout>

## Limitations

- Emojis currently have limited support within post and comment bodies.
  Custom emojis are unsupported and will appear in **:colon:** text form.
