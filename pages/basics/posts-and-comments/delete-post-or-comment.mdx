# Delete a Post or Comment

Once you delete your message in Slack, we'll remove the corresponding post or comment in the Tightknit site.

## Slack Action

When you delete your Slack message using the [Delete action](https://slack.com/help/articles/202395258-Edit-or-delete-messages#delete-a-message), your post or comment will
automatically be removed from the Tightknit site.

### Posts

Deleting a top-level Slack message will remove the corresponding post _and_ and of its comments from the Tightknit site.

### Comments

Deleting a message reply in Slack will remove only that comment from the Tightknit site. The post and the remainder of the comments will be preserved.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  Deleting the Tightknit bot notification reply will also remove the post and
  any of its comments from the Tightknit site. To stop all bot post replies,
  enable Quiet Mode.
</Callout>

## Message Shortcut - Remove from Tightknit Site Only

If you want to preserve your message in Slack and remove it only from the Tightknit site, you can use the Tightknit [message shortcut](../message-shortcuts).
