# Delete a Post or Comment

Once you delete your message in Slack, we'll remove the corresponding post or comment in the community.

## Slack Action

When you delete your Slack message using the [Delete action](https://slack.com/help/articles/202395258-Edit-or-delete-messages#delete-a-message), your post or comment will
automatically be removed from the community.

### Posts

Deleting a top-level Slack message will remove the corresponding post _and_ and of its comments from the community.

### Comments

Deleting a message reply in Slack will remove only that comment from the post in the community. The remainder of the comments will be preserved.

## Message Shortcut - Remove from Community Only

If you want to preserve your message in Slack but remove it only from the community, you can use the Tightknit [message shortcut](../message-shortcuts.mdx).
