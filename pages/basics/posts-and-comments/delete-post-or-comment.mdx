# Delete a Post or Comment

Once you delete your message in Slack, we'll remove the corresponding post or comment in the Tightknit companion site.

## Slack Action

When you delete your Slack message using the [Delete action](https://slack.com/help/articles/202395258-Edit-or-delete-messages#delete-a-message), your post or comment will
automatically be removed from the Tightknit companion site.

### Posts

Deleting a top-level Slack message will remove the corresponding post _and_ its comments from the Tightknit companion site.

### Comments

Deleting a message reply in Slack will remove only that comment from the Tightknit companion site. The post and the remainder of the comments will be preserved.

<Callout type="info">
  Deleting the Tightknit bot responder's reply is another way to trigger the
  removal of the post, and any of its comments, from the Tightknit companion
  site. This reply is only present if the bot responder hasn't been muted.

## Message Shortcut: Remove from Tightknit Companion Site Only

If you want to preserve your message in Slack and remove it only from the Tightknit companion site, you can use the Tightknit [message shortcut](/shortcuts/message-shortcuts#tightknit-shortcuts).
