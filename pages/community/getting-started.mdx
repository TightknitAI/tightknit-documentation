## Tightknit Hub Channel

When you first set up your Tightknit community, we will create a private channel that will serve as your Tightknit notifications hub. We will send important analytics, updates, and alerts about your community here. This is a private channel that should only include select admins.

By default, the channel is named **`tightknit-hub`**, but you are free to rename it to anything you like!
