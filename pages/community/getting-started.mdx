# Getting Started

The "Community" is the primary Tightknit object that is associated with your Slack workspace. It is an umbrella over other Tightknit modules which you may enable and disable for your Community.

If you are new to Tightknit, follow the [guided setup flow](/getting-started#create-the-community) to configure your Community! Admins can access the Community settings under the **Community** section in the Tightknit app Home.

## Tightknit Hub Channel

When you first set up your Tightknit community, we will create a private channel that will serve as your Tightknit notifications hub. We will send important analytics, updates, and alerts about your community here. This is a private channel that should only include select admins.

By default, the channel is named **`tightknit-hub`**, but you are free to rename it to anything you like!

<Callout>
  We may be unable to create the Tightknit Hub channel, especially if your
  workspace does not allow non-admin users to create private channels. To fix
  this, you can either [modify that
  permission](https://slack.com/help/articles/360052445454-Manage-permissions-for-channel-management-tools)
  for your Slack workspace and try again, or set the Tightknit Hub to a channel
  of your own choice in the [Admin Settings](/community/admin-settings).
