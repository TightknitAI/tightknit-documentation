## Community Settings

Within the Community Settings modal, you can configure the following:

- **Community Name** - This is the name of your community.
  When Slack users interact with our bot in public channels, our bot user will adopt the name of the community and the icon of your Slack workspace. In other words, you can maintain your community branding without distracting your users with a "Tightknit" bot.
- **Bot Icon** - This is the user icon that the Tightknit bot will adopt when interacting with community members. By default, it will be the icon of your Slack workspace. Recommended size is 48 x 48 px.
