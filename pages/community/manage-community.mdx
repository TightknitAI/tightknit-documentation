## Community Details

Within the Community Details modal, you can configure the following:

- **Community Name** - This is the name of your community.
  When Slack users interact with our bot in public channels, our bot user will adopt the name of the community and the icon of your Slack workspace. In other words, you can maintain your community branding without distracting your users with a "Tightknit" bot.

Here's an example of the Tightknit bot interacting with a thread while using the name and icon of the community "Pinnacle Solutions".
