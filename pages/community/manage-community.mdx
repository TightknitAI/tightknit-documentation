# Manage the Community

These settings allow you to configure your Tightknit app and how it interacts across your entire Slack workspace.
You can find these settings in your Tightknit Slack app under the `Community` section.

## Community Details

Within the Community Details modal, you can configure the following:

- **Community Name** - This is the name of your community.
  When Slack users interact with our bot in public channels, our bot user will adopt the name of the community and the icon of your Slack workspace. In other words, you can maintain your community branding without distracting your users with a "Tightknit" bot.
