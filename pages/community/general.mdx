# General Settings

You can access the General settings for the Community by clicking the `General` button under the **Community** module in your Tightknit app home.

## Community Details

Within the Community Settings modal, you can configure the following:

- **Community Name** - This is the name of your community.
  When Slack users interact with our bot in public channels, our bot user will adopt the name of the community and the icon of your Slack workspace. In other words, you can maintain your community branding without distracting your users with a "Tightknit" bot.

## Community Images

Within the modal, you can additionally configure the following images associated with your community's brand in the Slack workspace:

- **Community Horizontal Logo** - used in certain graphics to represent the community brand
- **Community Icon** - used as the Bot user icon when sending Slack messages to members of the community

For more information on the specs and recommendations of these images, see the [Branding Guide](/branding#image-assets).

Here's an example of the Tightknit bot interacting with a thread while using the name and icon of the community "Pinnacle Solutions".
