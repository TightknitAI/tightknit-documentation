# Slack Invite Link

Within the Slack Invite Link modal, you can register your Slack workspace's shared invitation link with Tightknit. You can find your invite link [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#share-an-invitation-link).

Once you've registered your invite link with Tightknit, we recommend _never_ directly using that link anymore and instead using the `/join` URL of your Tightknit companion site. Why? Our URL will never change, and as it sends users to your Slack invite link, we'll keep track of who uses it to join your workspace!

<Callout type="info">
  Each admin user in the workspace can generate their own unique shared invite
  link. You can register any of those links with Tightknit.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  A Slack invitation link expires after it is used for 400 successful sign-ups.
  You must then [generate a new link](#generate-a-new-invite-link) and register
  it again with Tightknit. Don't worry — we'll remind you when you're nearing
  the limit!

## Generate a new invite link

Is your link expired or expiring? Go into your Slack workspace admin settings. Select the "Invitations" page under the administration menu, i.e., the URL is at `/admin/invites`. Click on the "Invite Links" tab. Find the user whose link was registered with Tightknit and click "Deactivate."

Now, simply [repeat the process to generate an invite link](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#share-an-invitation-link). Don't forget to register again it with Tightknit!
