# Permission Sets

A Permission Set is a collection of permissions and priveledges that can be granted to a user (_coming soon_) or a Group.

A user's permissions are calculated as the superset of all Permission Sets assigned to them or assigned to Groups that they are a member of. For example, to have event-related permissions, a user must be a member of at least one Group with an assigned Permission Set containing event permissions.

## How to Access

Admins can access Permission Sets settings by clicking the `Permission Sets` button under the **Community** module.

From the Permission Sets List panel, admins are able to view, manage, and create Permission Sets.

## Create a Permission Set

To create a new Permission Set, click the `Create Permission Set` button. Within the Permission Set creation modal, you can configure the following:

- **Name** - the name associated with your Permission Set
- **Permissions** - list of permissions enabled for this set
  - **Events Champion** - the user has the ability to draft new events, submit them for admin approval, edit their own events, and delete their own events. They will also be able to access `Events` from the app home.
  - **Give Badges** - the user has the ability to [give Badges](/gamification/badges#send-a-badge) to members of the Community.
