# Admin Settings

In the Admin Settings, you can configure the following:

- **Tightknit Hub Channel** - the Hub channel is where Tightknit sends important notifications, analytics, and alerts about your community. You can switch this to any private channel, and Tightknit will start sending updates to that channel instead. The channel cannot have a Tightknit Feed connected to it.
