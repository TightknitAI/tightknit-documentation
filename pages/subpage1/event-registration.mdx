# Event Registration

When you create or edit an event, you will be able to enable and configure registration settings for the event within Slack.

## Admin Global Settings

Admins can configure global event settings by clicking the `Event Settings` button under the **Events Promotion** module on the app home page.

- **Registration Button Text** - defines the label used for the event's registration button
- **Event Unregistration** - when enabled, users have the option to remove themselves from events they have registered for

## Event Settings

When you create or edit an event, you will be able to configure registration settings for that event under the **Registration Settings** section.

- **Show registration button for event** - enables users to register for the event
- **Use Event Link for registration button** - when enabled, the registration button will redirect users to the URL provided in the _Link_ field. The link will no longer be shown in the event body. You must have the registration button enabled and a URL defined in the event _Link_ field.
- **Make guest list and guest count public** - when enabled, all users are able to see the number of attendees and the guest list for published events
- **Webhook for Registration Data** - the webhook endpoint to send [registration data](#events-webhook) to. Each time a user changes their registration for this event (i.e. registers / unregisters), a request is sent to the specified webhook.
- **Webhook Custom Metadata** - this value is included as a string in the `custom_metadata` field of the payload sent to the events registration webhook. Can be used to configure [one-click registration](#one-click-registration) by including metadata from a third-party event system.

## Events Webhook

Each time a user registers or unregisters for a Tightknit event in Slack, we send information about the registration event to your webhook URL.

The payload includes the action and status (e.g. `registered` vs `unregistered`), information about the Tightknit event, information about the user, the source of the interaction, and the event's custom metadata (if configured). The user info also includes [custom profile fields](https://slack.com/help/articles/212281478-Customize-member-profiles) configured for Slack profiles in the workspace.

## One-click Registration

Prevent your users from having to make redundant registrations in multiple places! If your event registration info lives on a third-party platform (e.g., Zoom, Luma, Google Calendar, etc), you can configure one-click registration for your Tightknit events by taking advantage of the webhook feature. In other words, when a user clicks "Register" in Slack, their registration information is forwarded to another system like Zoom.

This is a high-level guide of the steps you might take:

<Steps>
### Create webhook endpoint

In a webhook application of your choice (e.g., [Zapier](https://zapier.com/features/webhooks), [Make](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/gateway)), create a webhook endpoint that will listen for Tightknit events. Copy the URL of the endpoint. For example, a webhook URL from Zapier might look like this: `https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/abcd1234`

### Register the webhook in Tightknit

In the [Tighktnit webhooks admin settings](/integrations/webhooks), register the webhook URL from the previous step as a new webhook.

### Find relevant metadata for event on third-party platform

Determine what information is required to match the event from Tightknit with the event on your third-party platform. Typically, this is a unique identifier (ID) for the event. For example, a Zoom webinar might have an ID like this: `88333096148`.

### Configure Tightknit event webhook custom metadata

To edit your event in Tightknit, use the `/events` command, find your event in the list, and select `Edit Event` from the drop-down menu. Under the [**Registration Settings**](#event-settings) section, configure the following:

1. Select the webhook from Step 2 for the **Webhook for Registration Data**
2. Enter the metadata from the Step 3 in the **Webhook Custom Metadata** field

Each time a user clicks the registration button in Slack, Tightknit will send a payload to your webhook URL that contains the custom metadata. You can use this custom metadata to connect the registration information in the third-party platform.

### Set up webhook application workflow

In the webhook application of your choice from Step 1, configure a workflow to take in the [event registration data from Tightknit](#events-webhook). Forward this data to the third-party platform, and connect it to the correct record on that platform by matching on the custom metadata from Step 4.
